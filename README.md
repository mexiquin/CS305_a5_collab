# CS305_a5_collab

## Description
To make things a little interesting, this project will simply host "hello world" code for any language of your choosing!

Java, C++, Python, Bash, MIPS Assembly, its totally up to you!

## What to do
You will make your additions to the __CONTRIBUTING__ file of this repo. _Each entry will get its own line in the file._ All you have to do is:

- Include the name of the language
- A line of code that would simply print the phrase "hello world" to stdout in your language of choice
- Include your name. If you are a _contributor_ make sure to denote that when you write your name.

### Examples
```
// non-contributor (aka, you forked the repo)
C++ - cout << "Hello World" << endl; - Quinton Jasper
```

```
// contributor (aka, I sent you an invite, and you are now a part of this project)
Go - fmt.printf("Hello World") - Quinton Jasper (Contributor) 
```

If you want, you can even change the language of the phrase!

"Bonjour le Monde", "こんにちは世界", and "你好,世界" are also valid, and is totally up to you if you want to do it.
